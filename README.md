üì¶<b>Gift Of Language - CFG degree project</b>

‚ÑπÔ∏è<b>Overview</b>:

[Insert a paragraph explaining your work, who we are, and why we made it.]


Having a rich and varied vocabulary  can make it easier for you to express yourself or explain concepts both verbally and in writing. Developing your vocabulary can be challenging, especially when it not your native language. The aim of the app is to be a supplementary resource for the learning of the english language by helping them build and grow on their existing english vocabulary. The app hopes to achieve this by providing a unique word each day for the user to learn. Along with the word, the app will also provide a definition, how to read/say the word phonetically and an example of the word being used in a sentence. Users can opt in to be notified about the word of the day. They can also search through previously learnt words. The Gift Of Language app is a member only app, this means that users will have to sign up and then log in to the app each time they want to use it. This is so that users progress and data can be stored and accessed in the future.  The words the app will use will come from a dictionary API ([https://dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)). The app will have one database with two tables; one that stores user information and the other that stores searched words.
