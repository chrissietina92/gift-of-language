# Documentation:
# I'm using this manual method below for the random word generator based on the words in our chosen api
# instead of using the random words library as :
# 1. A lot of the words don#t exist in the api we are using so the definition and examples etc can't be searched
# 2. The words it generates are extremely advanced english that i don't even know myself and aren't commonly used in day too day speaking

# GENERATING THE RANDOM WORD FOR USERS DAILY WORD
def randomWordGenerator():
    # Converting the text file of the dictionary words into a list of strings
    with open("english.txt", encoding="utf8") as wordDictionary:

            #  print(wordDictionaryList)    # the wordDictionary in list form
            #  print(wordDictionaryList)    # the wordDictionary in list form

    # Total number of dictionary words
    dictionaryLength = len(wordDictionaryList)
    #  print(dictionaryLength)

    # Generates a random number within the range of the index for the list of dictionary words
